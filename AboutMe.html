<main>
<p> I was born in a hospital east of tehran on March 20th,2006 or Esfand 29th,1384 . Ever since my birth i
    was diagnosed with number of diseases and my chances of survival was slim ,but i managed to pull through
    and came on top, and that mentality stayed with me to be strong , to be gallant , to be fearless no matter 
    what comes next.
    I'm 19 years old and i don't have any siblings.
    I grew up as a very shy boy. i didn't have much friends and my first school years were miserable for me 
    but i adapted and became a loveable and respectable character amongst my classmates in both elemantary and 
    middle school.
    High school years were my best years , i met my best friends there , after graduting high school
    i became somewhat depressed that i couldn't sit next to my classmates anymore and laugh about everything and goof
    around ,but i'm making my peace with it.
    I'm currently studying computer engineering over at UMA . there is more to be readabout my education in
    other section. </p>
